# Voting App (Static)

This is a snapshot of our two [voting app](https://github.com/DoSomething/voting-app) campaigns, [Celebs Gone Good](https://www.celebsgonegood.com) and [Athletes Gone Good](https://athletesgonegood.com). Since we are no longer running these campaigns, we've taken static snapshots of each application to host on S3.
